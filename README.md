## Magical Fonts
Add magical fonts from Princess Connect Re:Dive and Madoka Magica to your forum.

## Installation
First use composer to install the plugin.
```
composer require metric-void/flarum-ext-magic-fonts
```

Then, **you need to manually copy the fonts to your fonts folder**.
Copy `vendor/metric-void/flarum-ext-magic-fonts/storage/assets/fonts` to `public/assets/fonts`.
